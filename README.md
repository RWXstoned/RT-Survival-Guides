# RT-Survival-Guides
This repository contains a collection of survival guides (aka cheatsheets) that discribe different tools, techniques and procedures for both red teaming engagements and pentesting. 

All credits go to the great people in the info sec. community that shared their findings, tools and tips with the public. These guides are just a means to document what worked for me personally and to have that information available during engagement in which you my not have access to internet resources. 

I will regurarly update the guides and keep working on adding new content. If you want to collaborate, report any mistakes or notify me on missed references to tools/blogs/etc., let me know. 

## Survival Guides:
