# RT-Survival-Guides
This repository contains a collection of survival guides (aka cheatsheets) that discribe different tools, techniques and procedures for both red teaming engagements and pentesting. 

All credits go to the great people in the infosec community that shared their findings, tools and tips with the public. These guides are a collection of what worked for me personally and to have that information available during engagement in which you my not have access to all the internet resources. 

These guides may also be beneficial if you're preparing for exams like CRTO, OSEP, CPTX, CRTE, OSCP, etc. 

I will regurarly update the guides and keep working on adding new content. If you want to collaborate, report a mistake or notify me on missed references etc., let me know.
